Project: Lab 2 - Dinucleotide and Trinucleotide Analysis

Description:
I ve worked alone for this laboratory that analyzes a DNA sequence to find the percentage of all possible
dinucleotide and trinucleotide combinations.

Files Included:
- nucleotide_analysis_gui.py
- ReadMe.txt: This file
- Screenshot.jpg: Program output screenshot

How to Run:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. python nucleotide_analysis_gui.py


Features:
- Brute force generation of all 16 dinucleotide combinations (AA, AC, AG, AT, etc.)
- Brute force generation of all 64 trinucleotide combinations (AAA, AAC, AAG, etc.)
- Percentage calculation for each combination in the given sequence
- Sorted output showing results from highest to lowest percentage
- Summary with top 5 most frequent combinations
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) with tabs for easy navigation
- Custom sequence input capability
- Nucleotide composition analysis
