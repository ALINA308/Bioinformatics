                             ANALYSIS
===============================================================================

COMPARATIVE FINDINGS:
---------------------
1. Inverted Repeat Density:
   - All three genomes show similar densities (~55,000-57,000 per Mbp)
   - M. genitalium has the highest density (57,239.05 per Mbp)
   - B. subtilis has the lowest density (55,221.95 per Mbp)
   - Only 3.5% variation across all three species

2. Distribution by Length:
   - E. coli: 26.1% (6bp), 31.4% (5bp), 42.5% (4bp)
   - B. subtilis: 27.6% (6bp), 31.0% (5bp), 41.4% (4bp)
   - M. genitalium: 38.2% (6bp), 27.2% (5bp), 34.6% (4bp)

   M. genitalium shows a higher proportion of 6 bp repeats, suggesting
   potentially more stable/longer transposon terminal inverted repeats.

3. AT-rich Sequences:
   - M. genitalium shows high AT content in detected repeats (TATTTA, TTAATA,
     TTTTAA, AATACT, ATTATA) - consistent with its 32% GC content genome
   - E. coli and B. subtilis show more balanced nucleotide composition

4. Spacing Patterns:
   - Most detected inverted repeats have spacing between 10-100 bp
   - This is consistent with typical transposon structure where inverted
     repeats flank a transposase gene or insertion sequence

BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
------------------------
- Inverted repeats are hallmarks of transposable elements
- The high density suggests substantial transposon activity in these genomes
- 6 bp inverted repeats are particularly significant as they provide stronger
  structural stability for transposition mechanisms
- The similar densities across species suggest transposons play a comparable
  role in bacterial genome evolution

LIMITATIONS:
------------
1. Short repeat length (4-6 bp) increases false positive rate
2. Many detected repeats may be coincidental rather than functional
3. No confirmation of associated transposase genes
4. Limited spacing window (10-100 bp) may miss larger transposons
5. Does not distinguish between active and inactive transposons

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------
1. Increase minimum repeat length to 8-10 bp for higher specificity
2. Search for transposase gene sequences near detected inverted repeats
3. Analyze direct repeats (target site duplications) flanking the inverted
   repeats
4. Compare detected sequences against known transposon databases
5. Investigate if detected repeats correspond to known insertion sequences

===============================================================================
CONCLUSION:
-----------
The analysis successfully detected thousands of potential transposon sites
across all three bacterial genomes through inverted repeat identification.
The similar density patterns suggest that transposable elements are ubiquitous
features of bacterial genomes, regardless of genome size. M. genitalium,
despite having the smallest genome, maintains a comparable (even slightly
higher) density of inverted repeats, indicating that transposons are essential
components even in minimal genomes.
